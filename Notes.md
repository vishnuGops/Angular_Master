What is Angular?
-- Frontend javascript framework to build UI for apps. Helps build interactive, modern web user interface.
-- Collection of tools and features to build basic to complex web applications.
--Simplifies the process of building complex web applications by giving various rules and features and concepts to use.

Why a framework?
-- can write declaractive code instead of vanilla JS.
Vanilla JS - Step by step explicit instructions to web
Declarative JS - Used by Angular, where we define the target state or states which contains special instructions unlocked by angular. We can define target states to be custom, and write declarative code in markup and angular does the heavy lifting.
-- Use of components which are custom HTML templates which can be used to build overall inteface by breaking everything into simpler blocks. Not only simify components but also logic can be broken up making software dev simpler.
-- Embraces some OOP principles and concepts.
-- Uses Typescript not javascript. Typescript is javascript with strict and strong typing added. Easier to catch errors in typescript.
